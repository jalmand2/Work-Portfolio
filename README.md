## Description

This project is a mock-up of a portfolio website built for hiring employers to view a coder's projects, resume, and contact information. I built this project as a homework assignment to help me practice building a website using HTML and CSS. I learned a lot, especially on the importance of structuring an HTML page prior to creating the accompanying CSS.
